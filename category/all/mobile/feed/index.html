				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>FEATURES OF MOBILE COMMERCE</strong> The essence of mobile commerce revolves around the idea of reaching customers, suppliers, and employees regardless of where they are located. Mobile commerce is about delivering the right information to the right place at the right time. It gives users the ability to access the Internet from any location at any time, the capability to pinpoint an individual mobile terminal user’s location, the functionality to access information at the point of need, and a need-based data/information update capability. Mobile commerce has features not available to traditional e-commerce, some of which we discuss next:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ubiquity:</strong> Ubiquity is the primary advantage of mobile commerce. Users can get any information that they are interested in, whenever they want regardless of their location, through Internet-enabled mobile devices. In mobile commerce applications, users may be engaged in activities, such as meeting people or </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">traveling, while conducting transactions or receiving information. In this sense, mobile commerce makes a service or an application available wherever and whenever such a need arises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Reachability:</strong> Through mobile devices, business entities are able to reach customers anywhere anytime. With a mobile terminal, on the other hand, a user can be in touch with and available for other people anywhere anytime. Moreover, the user might also limit his/her reachability to particular persons or at particular times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Localisation:</strong> The knowledge of the user’s physical location at a particular moment also adds significant value to mobile commerce. With location information available, many location-based applications can be provided. For example, with the knowledge of the user’s location, the mobile service will quickly alert him/her when his or her friend or colleague is nearby. It will also help the user locate the nearest restaurant or ATM.</span></p>
<p>Entuit provide perfect tools for mobile commerce which can be used to invite more people and give proper information to the user on perfect time. Applications can be made in a way that user is passing by some store and the mobile start showing sales, new arrivals and more.</p>
